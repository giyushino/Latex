CS 31 Project 1 Report

1. The specific input I provided to the program built from original.cpp that produced incorrect, unusual, or nonsense output was: 20 total voters, -5 voted for Tarris, and -10 voted for Hump. The program stated that -25.0% percent of the voters voted for Tarris and -50.0% of the voters voted for Hump. Even though the input was technically valid, as every input was an integer, the output does not make sense. There can not be a negative percentage of voters supporting either candidate. Also, -5 + -10 does not add up to 20 total voters.

Exact input:
How many registered voters were surveyed? 20
How many of them say they will probably vote for Trarris? -5
How many of them say they will probably vote for Hump? -10

-25.0% say they will probably vote for Trarris.
-50.0% say they will probably vote for Hump.
Trarris is predicted to win the election.


2. The logic error I introduced into compile_error.cpp was that I switched the positions forTarris and forHump in line 30. This caused the program to print out the wrong predicted winner of the election. When I entered 20 total voters, 15 voted for Tarris and 5 voted for Hump, the program predicted Harris to win, even though they had a lower percentage of votes. 

Exact input:
How many registered voters were surveyed? 20
How many of them say they will probably vote for Trarris? 15
How many of them say they will probably vote for Hump? 5

75.0% say they will probably vote for Trarris.
25.0% say they will probably vote for Hump.
Hump is predicted to win the election.


3. The two errors I introduced to compi;e_error.cpp were:
    1. I removed "int numberSurveyed;", meaning that when numberSurveyed was used in the program, it was not declared, thus causing an error. 
    2. I removed a semicolon in the line "cout << pctTrarris << "% say they will prob   ably vote for Trarris." << endl;", causing a syntax error. 

This is the exact error I recieved after trying to compile it:
compile_error.cpp:13:20: error: 'numberSurveyed' was not declared in this scope
   13 |             cin >> numberSurveyed;
      |                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
compile_error.cpp:26:87: error: expected ';' before 'cout'
   26 |             cout << pctTrarris << "% say they will probably vote for Trarris." << endl
      |                                                                                       ^
      |                                                                                       ;
   27 |             cout << pctHump << "% say they will probably vote for Hump." << endl;
      |             ~~~~
