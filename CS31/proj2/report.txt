if name = b=nymber
round if edge case?  
is there a case where the cost shoudl round up?


Project 2:

As someone who has never used a language where variable types need to be declared, I found the whole process of deciding what type a certain variable should be quite challenging. For example, I knew double and float could both be used to store decimal numbers, but I wasn't sure which one to use. However, after some research, I learned that double is more precise than float. Even though both variable types are valid to use for the scope of this project, I ended up using double. Another challenge I had was learning to deal with invalid inputs and clearing the buffer. There were many moments where I believed I had finished the project, only for one of the testcases to fail because I didn't clear the buffer. I struggled specifically with the invalid inputs into a char, but after reviewing the lecture slides, I got into the habit of clearing the buffer and ignoring a large number of lines. 

The biggest hurdle I faced this project was a bug with the boolean flags I set to mark if the user had inputted an inproper value. At first, I did not initialize any of the boolean flags, as I didn't yet have the habit of initializing any of my variables. However, near the end stage of finishing up this project, I kept on running into a bug where even if the coffee type was valid, the program would still mark it as incorrect and output an error message at the end. After going crazy for a good 30 minutes, I decided to manually set each flag to false, and voila! The bug was fixed, and I realized the importance of initializing variables. 

Test case 1: I used this testcase because it has all valid inputs, and the output should match the example given in the project 
Input: 
Customer's first name: Allan
Number of cups: 3
Type of coffee (r=regular, d=decaf): r
Any extra items? (y/n): y
Day of the week: Wednesday

Output:
The total charge for Maria is $11.86


Test case 2: I used this testcase to test if the program could handle a multiple word input for name, and to see if it could correctly set the name_flag to true.
Input: 
Customer's first name: allan zhang
Number of cups: 3
Type of coffee (r=regular, d=decaf): r
Any extra items? (y/n): y
Day of the week: Wednesday

Output:
The first name must start with an uppercase letter.


Test case 3: I used this testcase for the same reasons as above, but I also wanted to test if the program could handle an invalid input for the number of cups. Also with 2 errors, I needed to test if the program would only output the first error message.
Input: 
Customer's first name: allan zhang
Number of cups: x
Type of coffee (r=regular, d=decaf): r
Any extra items? (y/n): y
Day of the week: Wednesday

Output:
The first name must start with an uppercase letter.


Test case 4: I used this testcase for the same reasons as above, but I also wanted to test if the program could handle an invalid input for the number of cups. Also with 2 errors, I needed to test if the program would only output the first error message.
Input: 
Customer's first name: allan zhang
Number of cups: x
Type of coffee (r=regular, d=decaf): r
Any extra items? (y/n): y
Day of the week: Wednesday

Output:
The first name must start with an uppercase letter.
